(Sorry about the README in the repo. I will fix it tomorrow and officially publish HyprKenso - My First Dream Project)

Hope u guys will like it. Built with love and keeping it simple for even beginners to understand and configure it according to their needs. (Has a lot of features handy for your workflow. Based on my experience I have tried to incorporate all the features that I would personally need and removed all the bugs I encountered).
!! Install script has been tested on an Arch Linux VM with 4GB RAM. Works fine.
**Requirements:**

* Arch Linux / Base Arch Server Setup (I personally use linutil by Chris Titus Tech)
* git
* yay aur helper
* chaotic aur enabled to avoid compilation of some packages.

Then You will be Good to Go. For more information check HyprKenso Github repo [https://github.com/aadritobasu/HyprKenso](https://github.com/aadritobasu/HyprKenso)
